## 📁 Modules & Responsibilities

### 1. User Management  
Handles user registration, login, and profile management.

### 2. Body Type Calculator & Color Analysis  
Helps users identify their body type using measurements and suggests ideal color palettes.

### 3. Outfit Suggestions  
Provides fashion advice and trendy outfit recommendations tailored to body shape and skin tone.

### 4. Hair Care & Hairstyles *(by Sreelakshmi N J)*  
This module suggests suitable hairstyles and haircare tips based on the user's **face shape** and **hair type**.  
The logic works as follows:
- The user selects their face shape (e.g., oval, round, square) and hair type (e.g., straight, wavy, curly) via a form.
- This input is sent to the backend, which searches a database of hairstyle recommendations.
- Matching records are fetched based on both selected criteria.
- The result is then displayed to the user as a suggestion with images and descriptions.

This logic ensures that users receive hairstyle suggestions that are practically suitable for their physical features.

### 5. Skincare Routine  
Recommends skincare routines based on skin type and concerns (dry, oily, sensitive, etc.)
